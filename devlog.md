Starting Project 1. It's three programs: a logger, an encryption program, and a
driver that launches the other two and talks to them through pipes. I'm using
Python with subprocess because I know Python the best and it's the most
intuitive for me to write.

I went through the in-class example. cpu.py starts mem.py with Popen, sends it
lines, and reads replies with readline(). mem.py flushes after every print,
which I think is because output to a pipe gets buffered. Without the flush the
reply would just sit in mem.py's buffer, and cpu.py would be stuck waiting on
readline() forever. My driver will do the same thing but with two children. The
encryption program needs stdin and stdout piped since it sends replies back, but
the logger only needs stdin since it writes to a file.

This session I'm setting up git and starting encryption.py. I'll test it by hand
with the spec's example (key HELLO, HELLO → OIWWC).
